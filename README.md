It is a sample project showcasing integration of Phone Call in Android using Java with both static as well as dynamic value. 
First option is of static value wherein user will not have an option to input phone number as the phone number will be fixed which will already be defined within the Application.
Second option is of dynamic value wherein the phone number will not be defined by default.
